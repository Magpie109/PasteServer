Methods
Study Design

Using a retrospective study design, routinely collected HIV testing data from five health facilities in the western region of Kenya were used to develop a sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics-based risk-score algorithm for targeting HIV testing. Data from one high-volume facility were used to externally validate the algorithm. Development and validation of the risk-score algorithm followed systematic methodology that has been well described [46–49].
Study Sites and Setting

Homa Bay, Siaya and Kisumu Counties have the highest HIV prevalence (range 16%–21%) in Kenya, and combined, have approximately 384,000 people living with HIV [50]. These counties accounted for 23% of all outpatients tested for HIV nationally in 2017, with 1,696,836 adults tested and 23,805 HIV-positive patients identified (1.4% HIV-positive yield) [51]. Data from seven health facilities that had the highest (1000–5000) average monthly outpatient department visits in the three counties were considered for inclusion in our analysis. Although all seven of the selected health facilities routinely collected HIV behavioral risk data as part of HIV testing and counseling services, one facility was found to inconsistently document behavioral risk information and was therefore excluded.

The six health facilities included in our study offered provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling to outpatients using an opt-out approach. This included screening for HIV-testing eligibility, and provision of pre-test counseling, testing, and post-test counseling to eligible clients. Eligibility for HIV testing was based on the 2015 Kenya Ministry of Health HIV testing guidelines [11], which recommend testing individuals who have never been tested for HIV; individuals whose last reported negative HIV test result was more than 12 months ago, or who do not know the date of their most recent HIV test; individuals who have signs, symptoms, or a diagnosis of tuberculosis or STI; and those who report recent HIV exposure. In March 2017, eligibility for HIV testing was expanded in order to increase access to HIV testing services. The expanded eligibility criteria included individuals reporting a negative HIV test result in the past 3 to 12 months, and those reporting a negative HIV test result in the past < 3 months, but for whom the test result could not be confirmed in clinic records. Eligible patients were tested for HIV according to the Ministry of Health guidelines using Determine™ and First Response™ rapid point-of-care kits; an individual was considered HIV-negative (uninfected) if the Determine test result was negative, HIV-positive (infected) if the Determine and First Response serial test results were positive, and inconclusive if the Determine result was positive and the First Response result was negative. From September 2017, the health facilities in our study used standardized forms to document behavioral risk characteristics routinely assessed by HIV-testing counselors to guide HIV prevention counseling during pre-test counseling sessions.

Our analysis included data from clients aged 15 years and older who were tested for HIV between September 2017 and May 2018 in the outpatient departments of the 6 study sites, and who had documentation of one or more behavioral risk characteristics. Records for patients with inconclusive HIV test results were excluded. At the six health facilities, data for an entire month were excluded if ≥ 50% of patients tested for HIV in that month did not have any documentation of behavioral risk characteristics.
Data Management

Sociodemographic, HIV screening and testing, and behavioral risk information were recorded manually on Ministry of Health registers and standardized forms. At each health facility, the data were reviewed for completeness and accuracy, and entered into a secure password-protected database with in-built data consistency checks. Data meeting the study inclusion criteria were stripped of all identifiers (names and unique patient numbers), assigned new evaluation-specific identification numbers, entered into a study-specific secure password-protected database, and encrypted. Encrypted de-identified data were uploaded from each facility to a central database.
Risk-Score Algorithm Development

Adult outpatient HIV testing data from five of the six health facilities included in our study were used to develop overall and gender-specific risk-score algorithms; two facilities were in Kisumu County (a referral hospital and sub-county hospital), two were in Homa Bay County (a county and sub-county hospital), and one was in Siaya County (a county hospital). These five facilities accounted for approximately 7% of adult outpatients tested for HIV in the three counties in 2017.

The primary outcome in this analysis was an HIV-positive test result. Sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics were considered for inclusion in the development of the predictive model if they were among those routinely collected during the pre-test counseling phase of HIV testing, and have been shown [27, 33, 52–54] or hypothesized to be associated with HIV infection. These included: sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, marital status and occupation); behavioral characteristics (change in sexual partners, number of sexual partners, consistent condom use, had sex in exchange for money/favors, engaged in sex work, men who reported having sex with men, female anal sex, injecting drugs for pleasure, had sex under the influence of alcohol or other substance, and coerced to have sex); reported treatment for STI; circumcision status; and specific reasons for HIV testing eligibility (never tested for HIV, interval since last HIV-negative test, having tuberculosis, having an STI, and reporting recent HIV exposure). Characteristics such as education level, having an HIV infected sexual partner [52] and involvement in fish trade [38], which have been shown to be associated with HIV infection in other studies, were not routinely collected.

Development of the HIV infection predictive model was conducted in a systematic fashion, using univariable and multivariable analyses. As recommended for continuous variables [55–57], the association between age and HIV infection were assessed using a generalized additive model; the predicted odds of HIV-positivity by age were plotted, and informed age categorization into 5-year bands. The age-bands were further categorized into groups according to their HIV prevalence (the proportion of HIV infected individuals) as follows: ages 15–19, 20–24 and ≥ 50 years (HIV prevalence range of 0.33%–0.99%); ages 25–29, 30–34 and 45–49 years (HIV prevalence range of 1.32%–1.68%); and ages 35–39 and 40–44 years (HIV prevalence range of 1.97%–2.49%).

Univariable analysis was conducted to assess the independent association between the sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics and HIV infection, by computing odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values (significant at p ≤ 0.05). Two variables were not included in the univariable analysis: having sex in the prior 12 months, as multiple characteristics were assessed only for those who had sex in the prior 12 months, and consistent condom use with a sexual partner, as the documentation format made this variable difficult to interpret.

The initial full multivariable analysis included all variables with a significant higher odds (OR > 1.0) of HIV infection in univariable analysis, and those selected based on prior knowledge of an association with HIV infection. The variables in the full multivariable analysis were evaluated in a stepwise multivariable logistic regression, that incorporated Akaike information criterion for model selection, to identify the model/algorithm that best predicted HIV infection. Corresponding ORs, β regression coefficients and 95% CIs were computed. All participants with missing data were excluded from the univariable and multivariable analyses.

The final model was internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The ability of the final risk-score algorithm to discriminate between individuals with, and without, HIV infection was evaluated by computing the average area under the receiver operating curve (AUC, the area under a plot of sensitivity and the inverse of specificity) from the ten different cross-validation models. R-squared (R2) was computed to assess the extent to which the HIV prevalence variability can be explained by the model.

Risk-scores for each variable in the final model were created by multiplying the corresponding β regression coefficient by 10 and rounding to the nearest integer for ease of calculation. Each patient’s total risk-score was generated by summing the scores for all variables met.

To create risk-score categories, patient risk-scores were arranged in ascending order. The corresponding HIV prevalence for patients meeting each score was computed and used to identify mutually exclusive cut-points for unique risk-score groupings. The aggregate HIV prevalence and corresponding CIs were then calculated for each defined risk-score grouping.
Risk-Score Algorithm Validation

Data from Kisumu County Hospital, a health facility among the six high-volume sites selected for inclusion in our study, were used to externally validate the overall and the gender-specific risk-score algorithms developed. This hospital had the highest number (~ 38,000) of adult outpatients tested for HIV in 2017 in the three Counties of Siaya, Kisumu and Homa Bay. Procedures for HIV testing, documentation of sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and management of HIV testing data were similar to those earlier described for the other facilities included in the study.

For validation, each patient’s risk-score was generated using the risk-score algorithm developed, and patients were grouped into respective risk-score categories. HIV prevalence and corresponding CIs for each risk-score category were then calculated. The AUC and R2 were computed in order to assess the algorithm’s discrimination performance, and the extent to which variability in HIV prevalence is explained by the model, respectively.
Data Analysis

Data were managed using Stata Statistical Software version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and R version 3.6.2 [58]. The Classification And REgression Training (caret) package for predictive modelling was used to perform 10-fold cross-validation and to compute the AUC and R2.
Ethical Considerations

The Institutional Review Board of Kenyatta National Hospital (Nairobi, Kenya) approved the protocol to conduct this analysis. The protocol was also reviewed and approved according to the human research protection procedures for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia).

Results
Characteristics of Patients at the Five Health Facilities Used for Risk-Score Algorithm Development

Out of the 45 total months (9 months for each of the 5 health facilities) that data were eligible for inclusion in the study, data for 37 (82%) months met the inclusion criteria. During these months, 99.9% (27,685/27,692) of adults attending OPD services were screened for HIV testing eligibility, and 87% (21,764/24,966) of those eligible were tested for HIV. Of 21,745 patients with positive or negative HIV test results, 19,458 (89%) had behavioral risk characteristics documented and were included in our analysis.

Among the 19,458 patient records included, the median age was 29 years (interquartile range 22–43 years) and 11,149 (57%) were women (Table ​(Table1).1). Most patients [10,731 (61%)] were in monogamous marriage, and approximately two-thirds were either in trade/sales/service occupation [5467 (29%)] or were school/college going [5167 (27%)]. The majority of patients [18,450 (95%)] reported having sex in the prior 12 months, of whom 5038 (28%) reported having 2 or more sexual partners, and 2749 (17%) reported changes in sexual partners. Among those with changes in sexual partners, 1411 (51%) reported new sexual partners and 800 (29%) were widowed. Few patients reported having sex in exchange for money/favors/gifts [773 (4%)], having sex under the influence of alcohol/other substances [496 (3%)], having been coerced to have sex [480 (3%)], or having received treatment for STI in the prior 12 months [251 (1%)]. A minority of patients had never been tested for HIV [688 (3%)] or had a negative HIV test result > 12 months prior [12 (0.1%)] (Table ​(Table1).1). Overall, 210 (1.1%) patients were HIV-positive.

aManual occupation refers to both skilled and unskilled

bDue to multicollinearity, the characteristic “engaged in sex work, men who have with men, female anal sex, injecting drugs for pleasure in the prior 12 months” was excluded in univariable and multivariable analysis, while the characteristic “had sex in exchange for money/favors in the prior 12 months” was included

Compared to women, a significantly higher proportion of men were never married (30% vs 23%, p < 0.001), in a polygamous marriage (9% vs 3%, p < 0.001), in a manual/domestic occupation (12% vs 1%, p < 0.001), had ≥ 2 sexual partners (35% vs 22%, p < 0.001) and reported a new sexual partner in the prior 12 months (13% vs 6%, p < 0.001). Conversely, a significantly higher proportion of women were in monogamous marriage (64% vs 57%, p < 0.001), widowed (7% vs 2%, p 0.004), in a trade/sale/service occupation (32% vs 24%, p < 0.001), unemployed (19% vs 11%, p < 0.001), or reported being widowed in the prior 12 months (6% vs 2%, p 0.051, Table ​Table11).
Overall Risk-Score Algorithm Development

The following characteristics were positively significantly associated with HIV infection in univariable analysis: being aged 35–39 and 40–44 years; male gender; manual/domestic and trade/sales/service occupation; polygamous marriage, separated/divorced or widowed; in the prior 12 months having a new sexual partner, ≥ 2 sexual partners, or reporting treatment for STI; having never been tested for HIV; or having a negative HIV test result > 12 months prior (Table ​(Table22).

The final best-fit model/risk-score algorithm consisted of the following variables: age category 35–39/40–44 years; occupation (manual/domestic or trade/sales/service); marital status (polygamous marriage, separated/divorced or widowed); in the prior 12 months having ≥ 2 sexual partners or reporting treatment for an STI; and having never been tested for HIV or having a negative HIV test result > 12 months prior (Table ​(Table3).3). The final model/algorithm had an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.53–0.84) and R2 of 0.89.

The variables in the final algorithm were each assigned a risk-score, and each patient’s risk-score was calculated as the sum of risk-scores for variables met. Patients were grouped into the following 4 risk-score categories: ≤ 9 [HIV prevalence 0.6% (95% CI 0.46–0.75)], 10–15 [HIV prevalence 1.35% (95% CI 0.85–1.84)], 16–29 [HIV prevalence 2.65% (95% CI 1.8–3.51)], and ≥ 30 [HIV prevalence 15.15% (95% CI 9.03–21.27)] (Table ​(Table4).4). The 3 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 10) accounted for 55% of HIV-positive patients identified, yet represented just 24% of the total patients tested for HIV. Similarly, patients in the 2 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 16) accounted for 37% of HIV-positive patients identified, yet represented just 10% of the total patients tested for HIV.

Overall Risk-Score Algorithm Validation

The validation dataset consisted of 11,330 patient records, of which 174 (1.6%) were HIV-positive. The sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics of patients in the validation dataset are shown in Table ​Table5.5. In comparison to the development dataset, the validation dataset had a significantly higher proportion of patients with manual/domestic and trade/sales/service occupation, and a significantly lower proportion of patients who reported having ≥ 2 sexual partners in the prior 12 months, and having a negative HIV test result > 12 months prior (Table ​(Table55).

When applied to the validation dataset, the final risk-score algorithm/model had an AUC of 0.69 (95% CI 0.60–0.77) and R2 of 0.88. The risk score categories ≤ 9, 10–15, 16–29 and ≥ 30 had an increasing HIV prevalence of 0.97% (95% CI 0.76–1.18), 2.32% (95% CI 1.47–3.17), 3.69% (95% CI 2.62–4.76) and 6.76% (95% CI 1.04–12.48), respectively (Table ​(Table4).4). The 3 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 10) accounted for 49% of HIV-positive patients identified, but only 23% of the total patients tested for HIV. The 2 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 16) accounted for 31% of HIV-positive patients identified, but only 12% of the total patients tested for HIV.
Development of Gender-Specific Risk-Score Algorithms

Characteristics that were positively significantly associated with HIV infection in univariable analysis (OR > 1.0 at p ≤ 0.05) among men and women are shown in Supplementary Table SI. Full multivariable models for men and women are shown in Supplementary Tables SII and SIII. The AUC for the full model was 0.75 (95% CI 0.65–0.85) among men and 0.68 (95% CI 0.56–0.8) among women.

The final best-fit model/risk-score algorithm among men had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.56–0.96) and an R2 of 0.69, and consisted of the following variables: age categories 25–29/30–34/45–49 years and 35–39/40–44 years; occupation (manual/domestic or trade/sales/service); marital status (separated/divorced or widowed); in the prior 12 months having ≥ 2 sexual partners or a new sexual partner; circumcised status; and having never been tested for HIV (Supplementary Table SII).

The final risk-score algorithm among women had an AUC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.47–0.85) and an R2 of 0.87, and consisted of the following variables: age category 35–39/40–44 years; trade/sales/service occupation; marital status (polygamous marriage, separated/divorced or widowed); in the prior 12 months having a new sexual partner or reporting treatment for an STI; and having never been tested for HIV or having a negative HIV test result > 12 months prior (Supplementary Table SIII).

Risk-score categories and corresponding HIV prevalence among men and women are shown in Supplementary Table SIV. Among men, the 3 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 13) accounted for 86% of HIV-positive patients identified, yet represented 50% of the total patients tested for HIV. Similarly, among women, the 3 highest risk-score categories (score ≥ 8) accounted for 51% of HIV-positive patients identified, yet represented 23% of the total patients tested for HIV (Supplementary Table SIV).
Validation of the Gender-Specific Risk-Score Algorithm

The validation dataset comprised 4706 (42%) men and 6624 (58%) women. When applied to the validation dataset, the final algorithm/model had an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57–0.86) and an R2 of 0.85 among men, and an AUC of 0.66 (95% CI 0.49–0.84) and an R2 of 0.95 among women. The risk-score categories and corresponding HIV prevalence among men and women are shown in Supplementary Table SIV.
